# FER-through-Transfer-Learning-and-feedback

In this research project, we explore the first step in that direction: understanding
usersâ€™ needs and preferences in terms providing feedback to help the
system learn over time. We developed an online questionnaire, and
distributed it to 38 participants. Among other insights, we found
that users preferences significantly depends on the deployment
context of the FER system. We provide design recommendations
based on these findings. Our primary focus is the JAFFE dataset, 
combined with the existing algorithms that we have found on the github, 
and make improvements on the training process; for example, attempting using
unlabled pictures to train images to lower the errors.
